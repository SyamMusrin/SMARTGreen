	Select I2C interface and enable it

b. Install i2c-tools and python-smbus, after the installation is complete. reboot pi
	Open terminal:
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools python smbus
sudo reboot

c. Run sudo i2cdetect -l to see which i2c bus the current pi is using.
	Open terminal:
sudo i2cdetect -l
	Determine the system i2c bus is 1

d. Run sudo i2cdetect -y 1 to view the devices mounted on the i2c bus of the
current pi
	Open terminal:
sudo i2cdetect -y 1
	Address 0x62 is CW2015

e.Run the script with Python
